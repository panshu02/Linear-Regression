# Linear-Regression-using-Numpy-and-Python

The zeal for predicting things which are yet to happen or might happen is an admirable quality of humans. The regression curves aim to do just that by fitting a curve on to the given dataset and predicting what the possible outcomes might be in coming scenarios. The prohect uses basic python libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn to fit a linear model.

The optimized values of parameters for the linear curve are obtained using gradient descent (from scratch). The behaviour of the cost as a function of theta is studied and the value of cost as a function of iterations of the gradient descent is examined. The convergence behaviour with the convergence parameter is observed and a suitable alpha is chosen to achieve convergence.
